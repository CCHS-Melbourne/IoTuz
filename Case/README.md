IoTuz Case - A case for the Internet of Tuz board
=============

This case has been designed to be a "sandwhich" style case for your Internet of Tuz board.  It should fit snuggly over the battery socket and around the LCD touch screen.

This design was completed using Trimble Sketchup.  Not a particularly open source project, but one I actually know how to use.
A Board outline was exported as DXF from Kicad and that was used as exact measurements for holes and placements relative to the circuit board.
