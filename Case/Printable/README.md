3D printable case, created in Fusion 360.

Print the top, bottom, reset button, power switch
 and one of the 2 sets of ButtonA and ButtonB button caps
depending on whether you have 6mm button stems like I do, or
the 20.5mm long stemmed buttons as originally supplied.

If you're like me, you might need to sand some of the openings
in the case top for smoothness so the buttons and joystick
don't stick.
