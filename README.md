IoTuz - The Internet of Tux
=============


Welcome to the linux.conf.au 2017 Open Hardware Project.  You can see information about this and other MiniConfs at http://www.openhardwareconf.org/wiki/Main_Page

This year we're bringing a project with the hottest new micro for people to have a play with. The ESP32 is the successor to the hugely popular ESP8266 chip we used for 2016 Open Hardware Project, the (ESPlant, https://github.com/CCHS-Melbourne/ESPlant).

The ESP32 is definitely the big brother of the ESP8266.  Included in it's features:
* 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi
* Bluetooth
* Dual Core


As usual we've got a custom board and some custom software to get you started on your journey!  Check out the subdirectories in this repo for more information.

Getting IoTuz
---------------

You need to clone the IoTuz repo from github, using the `--recursive` option to pick up submodules. If you download a zip file then the submodule parts will be missing, so we recommend using git to get it.

The command is:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/CCHS-Melbourne/IoTuz
```


Where to Now?
-------------

Check out (and contribute to) [the wiki](https://github.com/CCHS-Melbourne/IoTuz/wiki). There is a pinout summary, sensor summary, power information, etc.
